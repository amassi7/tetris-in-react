# Tetris in React.js
An experiment with React.js. Built a Tetris game using JavaScript and React.

# To run:
Inside `teris`, run `npm install`
Then run `npm start`. You should get a localhost address.
Note: If the size of the game is too large, try reducing the size of the window.

# To play: 
Move tetromino to the right: right arrow key
Move tetromino to the left: left arrow key 
Move tetromino one cell downwards: down arrow key
Rotate tetromino: up arrow key
Move tetromino all the way down: space key

Followed the Restful Coder's tutorial on YouTube.
